# First Assignment

## User Story
As a marketing agency, I want a codebase that follows accessibility standards so that our own site is optimized for search engines.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Given a webpage meets accessibility standards
- When I view the source code
  - Then I find semantic HTML elements
  - When I view the structure of the HTML elements
    - Then I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
  - When I view the image elements
    - Then I find accessible alt attributes
  - When I view the heading attributes
    - Then they fall in sequential order
  - When I view the title element
    - Then I find a concise, descriptive title

## Changes Made
- Rewrote HTML and consolidated portion of CSS for better semantic flow
- Added accessible Alt attributes
- Found Title to be concise, HTML elements follow logical structure

## Unresolved Issues
- Still working on fixing section.benefits element (floats to the bottom below 1616px)
- Containers sitting oddly
- cant get deployment page to correctly link assets
