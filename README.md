## 🚀 User Story
As a marketing agency, I want a codebase that follows accessibility standards so that our own site is optimized for search engines.

## 🎯 Acceptance Criteria
- **Webpage Meets Accessibility Standards**
  - **Source Code Inspection**: Semantic HTML elements are present.

  - **Image Accessibility**: All image elements have accessible alt attributes.
  - **Heading Hierarchy**: Headings are in a sequential order.
  - **Title Element**: The title is concise and descriptive.

## 🛠️ Changes Made
